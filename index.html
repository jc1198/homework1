<h1>Jorge Cazares</h1>

<p>I am a student in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. My studies focus on user experience design, and I am also pursuing a minor in economics.

I am originally from Chicago and have worked in a variety of positions. Some of these include as a policy intern for city hall in Chicago, an IT department intern for a tech consulting firm called LaSalle Solutions and as a research assistant for Poverty Solutions at the University of Michigan.</p>
